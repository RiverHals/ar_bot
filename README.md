# ar_bot 
Code for a controlled with arduino bot. 
## Basic control access:
Determine by experiment the values of the required parameters, update them in code. Determine theoretical parameters
- for basic_control : signals, speed, turn delay, speed delta 
- for heart\_shaped\_trace : + diam, one\_loop\_time, iter\_straight\_time
